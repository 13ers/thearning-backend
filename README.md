# About This Project
Thearning is an LMS (Learning Management System) written in Rust.
It is my project for the new learning method for Software Engineering Major
at Vocational Highschool: PJBL or "Project-Based Learning".

## Why Rust?
Because it's the best language.

## No, seriously. Why are you writing it in Rust?
I was serious, tho. But well of course the main reason is for learning purpose.
I want to learn [rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs) and as well as
rest API. Also writing Rust is really fun - that's why.

# Will it actually be used?
Hope so. If this project's finished, I will offer this to my school.
The project will remain open source, but I probably will ask for some fee
for maintaining to my school.

# Contribution
PRs are welcome and they would probably save my time, too.

# Building
This is Rust, man. Just clone and run `cargo build`
